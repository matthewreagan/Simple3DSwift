# Simple 3D Swift

![Simple3DSwiftDemo](/simple3Ddemo.gif?raw=true "Simple3DSwift Demo")

A quick experiment in minimalist [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) coding and [3D math](https://www.amazon.com/Math-Primer-Graphics-Game-Development-ebook-dp-B008KZU548/dp/B008KZU548).

## The Goal

To create an interactive **3D [wireframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire-frame_model)** world using minimal Swift code and no **3D** or **graphics libraries** ([AppKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit) is used for keyboard event handling and basic drawing).

## Result

The 3D world is composed, rendered, and animated in about **200 lines** of **Swift** (code [here](/Simple3D.swift)), which includes geometry, event handling, and animation.

## Discussion

This code could be condensed further, and could certainly be improved in many ways (this is by no means a practical or robust 3D engine). Mostly this was an experiment to see if I could reduce the math for a basic 3D renderer down to the barest essentials.
